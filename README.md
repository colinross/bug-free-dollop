bug-free-dollop

Great repository names are short and memorable. Need inspiration? How about bug-free-dollop.

This is a work-in-progress of an extensible, sharable docker-compose-based ephemeral IDE (for terminal/console-based development).
Due to the way docker build and runs images (and how it deals with context and mounting volumes) this is more of a code-repo of sharable snippets more than just a drop in scripted environment. Don't look for a one-liner command to run here, there isn't one (yet)

*Roadmap*
 - script image creation/tagging
 - support for local docker repository
